# Front-End Coding Challenge

Hello potential Fool!  We’d love to give you the chance to show off your skills and impress us!  We want to see how you would build a project, how you communicate, and how you solve problems.  This is your chance to demonstrate skills beyond what we can see from your resume and from a talking-only interview.

If you are familiar with all the technologies we are requesting that you use for this challenge, we estimate it will take around **12-20 hours to complete**.  If you are learning some of these particular tools for the first time, it may take you longer, and that’s OK! Just keep us in the loop as to how things are going.  Feel free to spend more time on it if you are on a roll and can’t stop the awesome!


## What are we looking for:



*   Professional development work (clean, well-organized, appropriate comments, unit tests, no loose ends, sloppy spelling, or browser console errors).
*   Creative problem solving 
*   Solid analytical approach - are you solving the business problem, or just writing code?
*   Good communication with us as you are working on the project, so we can get a feel for what it would be like to work with you!


## The Challenge

The Motley Fool’s personal finance sister company, The Ascent, helps people find the best financial products.  For this challenge, we want to help people find the best credit card! People shop for credit cards for different reasons - maybe they want to consolidate debt, get free travel miles, cash back, or other rewards.  Unfortunately, not all cards are available to everyone (based on their credit score), so we need to help them find a card that they could actually apply for and likely get.

We have a list of cards we recommend for different situations that can be found through this REST API:

[https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/api/creditcardrecommendations/](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/api/creditcardrecommendations/)

If you browse to that URL, you can see the data in a web page, but if you hit that with an AJAX request, it will just return the JSON.

Using that API, we’d like you to design an interactive component that we can place on The Ascent’s web pages to help people quickly find good card options!


### Business Requirements



*   Portable component that can be easily added to any Ascent web page
*   Gives people information on cards to help them make decisions
*   Shows sorry text (from the API) if we don’t have good recommendations for their situation
*   Gives people the ability to immediately apply for cards (we get paid when they get accepted)
*   Needs to look really good on desktop and mobile
*   Fit into the aesthetic of The Ascent website and brand
*   Don’t show an Apply Now button for cards that don’t have an affiliate link URL
*   Built with re-usable parts that we can use for other tools
*   Wows shoppers and makes them want to come back to The Ascent for future needs!
*   Encourages them to apply now, and not wait!


### Technical Requirements



*   Use the latest Vue JS
*   Please don’t use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Bourbon, or Material. We need to keep our Ascent website super fast for maximum SEO!
*   Responsive for desktop (including large monitors) and mobile
*   Ideally works in IE11, as well as the latest Safari, Edge, Firefox, and Chrome
*   Code considers non-happy-paths
*   README document that explains how to run the code, how to embed it on an Ascent web page, and describes your design decisions and reasoning
*   If you can provide a URL of your code running somewhere (e.g. GitHub Pages, CodePen, Repl.It), that will make it super fast for us to enjoy the fruits of your labor!


### Tips



*   Don’t hesitate to ask questions, clarify things, or brainstorm with us! We want to get to know you as much as your code. :)
*   Be creative!
*   Have great attention to detail. Sometimes the smallest things turn people away. :(
*   Make it interactive! Engage and delight our customers!


### When you Finish



*   Upload your code to GitHub, and send us the URL of your GitHub repo with your finished challenge
*   If we like it enough to bring you in for an in-person interview, we’ll likely want to brainstorm enhancements and have you implement those on-site, so make sure you make your code easy to modify on the fly.
*   We may have questions and comments on your code, so keep an eye out. :)

**Thanks so much for wanting to be a Fool!**

**We are really working to make the world Smarter, Happier, and Richer!**
